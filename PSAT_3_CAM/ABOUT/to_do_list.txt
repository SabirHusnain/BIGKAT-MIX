To do list for the Postural Control Project:

Backend:

-Test synchrony between cameras. Sometimes there is a delay on one camera
-Camera calibration get frames raises an error when the last frame + 1 is called
	-This is actually fixed now. An excpetion occurs because the files are in the wrong folders OG 13/09/16
-Camera calibration places stereo calibration files into wrong folder. Place into the correct folders and automatically delete old files
-Test spatial layout of cameras. There is a relationship between position and accuracy
-Fix multicore marker tracking
-Data analysis:
	-What do we actually want as output?



GUI:

-Add basic GUI functionality
	-Start Recording Button - Start recording on RPi
	-Preview - Preview the cameras. Add a check button to enable marker tracking
	-Time to record for option (On camera or demographics window?)
	-Allow input of todays date (Is it worth getting a clock for the device)

-Finish virtual keyboard 
	-Allow to move to caps
	-Offset letter placement
	
-File management system

-Camera preview system

-Monitor device memory and warn when videos need deleting







Backend improvements (Not urgent):

-Kalman filter in Stan to reflect one moving object. Currently acts like tracking two independent objects
-Better blob detection (subpixel)
-Synchonize cameras post-hoc (could integrate into Kalman filter)
-Replace cameras with time locked cameras (If possible)
-Faster graphics processing (Better hardware or optimize with GPU)


GUI Improvements (Not Urgent):

-PySide2 is in development (wrapper for QT5). This could be useful in the future
